## Sort by comparison
- bubble sort
- insertion sort
- selection sort
- merge sort
- quick sort
- heap sort
- shell sort

## Sorted by data properties
- Counting sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket sort
- Geometric Sort

## hybride algorithm
- Timsort => between insertion and merging sort
- Bitonic sort => parralel network
- Odd-Even Sort => parrallel architecture
- IntroSort => start with quick sort, and then toggle toward heap if the partionning become efficient

## probabilistic Algorithms
- Bogo sort => use all the permutations til obtain the sorted list
