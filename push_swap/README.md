# push_swap

the **push_swap** project is an algorithm challenge where the goal is to sort a stack of integers using  aset of limited operations and aiming to minimize the number of operations performed. The project focuses on implementing efficient algorithms for sorting, and it's a great way to practice desing, as well as coding in C.

## Files

This file should serve as the entry point of the program, where you will implement the logic for solving the push_swap challenge. It will:
- Parse the arguments to build the initial stack
- Call appropriate functions to perform sorting
- Use functions from other files to perform operations on the stacks


- List of functions will go here.
