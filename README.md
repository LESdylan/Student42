# Welcome to My 42 Journey! 🚀
Hello, and welcome to my GitHub(**still building it**)! 👋

I'm a student at 42 School, a unique coding program that fosters self-learning, collaboration, and problem-solving in an exciting and fast-paced environment. In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects, resources, and tips that I’ve discovered and found incredibly helpful throughout my journey at 42. The goal is to share what has helped me survive (and thrive!) in this challenging, yet rewarding, program with others.

## About Me
I'm passionate about coding, technology, and continuously improving myself through hands-on projects. At 42, we face complex problems that require persistence, creativity, and strong logic. This experience has not only sharpened my technical skills but also my ability to learn independently and adapt to new situations.

## What to Expect Here
In this space, you’ll find a variety of resources and materials that cover topics and skills crucial to surviving (and succeeding) as a 42 student. I'll be sharing:

**📚 Project Insights**
- Deep dives into key projects I’ve completed at 42, including Libft, ft_printf, and many others.
- Tips, tricks, and insights that helped me through these projects.

**🛠️ Tools & Resources**
- Links to tutorials, articles, and external resources that were particularly useful during different stages of the curriculum.
- Guides to setting up development environments and using tools like vim, git, tmux, and more.

**💡 Programming Concepts & Problem-Solving**
Breakdown of essential concepts in C, algorithms, data structures, and more.
Problem-solving approaches and coding patterns that can help you tackle tricky exercises and exams.

**🧠 Mindset & Survival Tips**
Advice on how to navigate the sometimes overwhelming curriculum.
Time management strategies and how to keep a healthy balance between coding, learning, and personal life.
Dealing with peer-to-peer collaboration and code reviews in the best way possible.

**🤝 Collaboration & Open Source**
How to collaborate on projects, contribute to open-source, and make the most of the 42 peer-learning model.
I’ll also be hosting some open-source projects where contributions are welcome!
The Journey Ahead
This is just the beginning! As I progress through 42 and venture into new areas of computer science, you’ll see my repositories expand to cover even more topics like algorithms, system programming, web development, and beyond. The intention is to build a comprehensive resource hub for current and future 42 students or anyone interested in learning to code from scratch in a self-driven environment.

Feel free to fork, star ⭐, and explore! I hope you find value in the projects and resources I’ve gathered here. Let’s learn and grow together. 💻🌱
